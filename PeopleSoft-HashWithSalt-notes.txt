CPCEvalServer::EvalHash -> known to be sha1_64(utf16($p)) -> dynamic_1032 in JtR jumbo

CPCEvalServer::EvalHashWithSalt -> calls CmnHashMasterWithSalt -> (reversing needed here) -> calls SHA-1 and does base64 encoding -> similar to dynamic_1032?

CPCEvalServer::EvalHashSHA256 (calls CmnHashSHA256) is also of interest.
